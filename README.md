Question: What does the code on lines 25 and 29 do?
On line 25 we are telling the system not to automatically generate constraints based on the view's autoresizing mask.

Question: What is a safe area layout guide?

Question: What is [weak self] on line 23 and why it is important?
[weak self] creates a weak reference to self within the closure, preventing a strong reference cycle that could lead to memory leaks. This is important because if self is strongly retained by the closure, it may not be deallocated when expected, causing potential memory issues.

clipsToBounds is a property that restricts the drawing of a view's content to its bounds, meaning any subviews or content that extend beyond its edges will be hidden. 

Question: What is the valueChanged type? What is Void and what is Double?
var valueChanged: ((Double) -> Void)?
The type ((Double) -> Void)? means valueChanged is an optional closure that takes a Double as input and returns no value (Void). Here, Double represents the input value type (such as a slider's value), and Void indicates that the closure doesnâ€™t return any result.
